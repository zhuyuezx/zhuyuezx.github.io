We are well acquanted with cloud - looking up to the sky, we can easily see these changing clouds floating above. This seems so natural, but one doubt rise from my mind: why coluds can float? 

From physics, we know that clouds are made up of water droplets. Here is the problem - water have greater density than air, so why cloud can float? In this post, I'll briefly explain it and you can also check the video.

This research was conducted in December 2020 during first year university winter vacation.

The underlying video is the final result of my research. Sorry that all the contents are in Chinese.

**With heavy workload in university, I don't have time to upload an English version currently, but I will update a English version if I have time in 2022 summer, thank you!**
