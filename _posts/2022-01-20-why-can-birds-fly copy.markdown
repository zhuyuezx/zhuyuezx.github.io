This research was conducted in April 2020, and it is actually is pretty complicated question.
In one paragraph, there are **six strategies** in total (gif source: le peuple migrateur):
* **For the aspects that increase lift:**
    1. Elaborate constrution of birds' wings excellenctly combined with appropriate flying strategies

    2. Powerful air sacs system and double-loop breathing strategy

    3. Higher body temperature bringing stronger metabolism

* **For the aspects that reduce gravity:**
    1. Specialized bones that balance weight and firmness

    2. Streamline body structure

    3. Optimized organs based on requirement

Beyond the question itself, I further focused on these three following questions that doubted me a lot, which I've given my answers to them in the video after (but in Chinese... currently)
1. Where do birds evolve from and their relationship with dinosaur family?
2. Can I construct a physics model about birds' flying?
3. Why some birds cannot fly, like penguine and ostrich?

The underlying video is the final result of my research and **it was uploaded on [my bilibili channel](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1zz411b7kr?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0).** 

### Sorry that all the video contents are in Chinese.

**With heavy workload in university, I don't have time to upload an English version, but I will update a English version if I have time in 2022 summer, thank you!**
