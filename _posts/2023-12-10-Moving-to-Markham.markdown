Starting this May, I've been working as a Devops intern in IBM Markham office. It's a long-term internship, and although there's shuttle bus provided by IBM, it takes one hour for commuting to and from the office - it's really time-consuming. Therefore, I moved to Markham this June, and now it's 20 minutes walk to the office. So, inside this post, I'll put few updates about my life at Markham.

The photo at frontpage is the balcony view of my apartment, and it's nice that I can have some unblocked view of the surroundings.

## Purchasing a Car

After moving away from downtown Toronto, a car is necessary for shopping and daily commuting. So, the first thing I do is to get a car. Long story short, I've chose a 2014 Nissan Rouge, as it has a reasonable price and low mileage. I've been driving it for six months, and it helps me greatly as I need to go to UofT lab weekly for my research project - driving a car is much more convenient in most cases.

## Work at IBM 

I would say that Markham office really has a decent working environment, as each employee has a enclosed working space (great for concentration), with many occasional events (also free food). I've been working with the ADDI team and participating in the development cycle, where I've gained experience in frontend development and CI/CD pipeline. Recently, I'm working on the vscode extension for the ADDI platform.

## Some Random Stuff

There are also several interesting shots I've taken in Markham, and I'll put them here:
