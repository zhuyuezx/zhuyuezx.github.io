This research was conducted in June 2020. Although it seems nosense, actually there's a whole lot story about it - we can even start from the origin of cell.

In one paragraph, we can seperate my personal explainations into four connected steps:
1. Start fromt the definition of leaf - how shall we define leaf? 
2. What is the definition of color and is cholorphyll essential for photosynthesis?
3. Major difference between light reaction and dark reaction of photosynthesis
4. As lifes come from ocean - how speciality of aqua environment shape photosynthesis
5. ancient biological niche and **"purple earth" hypothesis**

The underlying video is the final result of my research. Sorry that all the contents are in Chinese.
