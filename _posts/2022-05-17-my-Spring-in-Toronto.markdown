Temperature in Toronto remained single-digit till late April, and this really gave me a 
bad feeling. In hometown Shanghai, usually leaves sprout in March, while here in Toronto, 
I've complained few times with friends and parents that "There's no spring in Toronto". 

Still, I have to say that starting from May, when leafbuds emerged from those lifeless bare branches, 
I can clearly feel the rhythm of life. 

## Here are some photos I got during commuting:

### Yesterday I caught sight of this lovely Canada goose family. Don't know how goose babies get here since they don't seems to be able to fly.

### It's hard to describe the joy of seeing blooming flowers after a long winter.
