The website is based on Jekyll's minima theme, and currenly uploaded and maintained by github pages

Some images used inside posts are created by myself using Processing and Adobe Photoshop, while the others come from **[unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)**, a great website that provides freely-usable images.

If you are interested in using jekyll to construct your own webpage, you can check more documentation at **[jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)**

I will put most of my coding works and research projects here. For the coding part, you can get the open-source code from my corresponding github repositories: **[my github homepage](https://github.com/zhuyuezx)**
